You may have to run: hexo generate to re-generate the published files, before deploying. how to add an \"about\" page and link it to the main menu create pages (instead of posts) (for linking to menu items) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29167023/how-to-add-route-for-hexo answer 1 You have to create a new page by runnning hexo new page \"about\". A folder will be created in source/. In this folder, there is a file named index.md. In this file, you can write the content of this page /about in markdown.
